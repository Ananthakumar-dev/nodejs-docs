const net = require("net")

Net module in node, you could create a TCP server or you could send TCP requests.

It's just here for us to help us with this whole TCP thing.

So it's the lowest level that you can get in node when you want to do networking.

So there are some other networking modules in node such as dns, http, but all of these modules are actually built on top of the Net module.

You could build an SSH server on top of the Net module.
