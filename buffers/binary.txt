(base 2 numbers)

we said that everything we have in our computer is just

zeros and ones and well what are zeros and ones.

They are just numbers right.

So let's try to understand these numbers.

Let's see what they represent.

Now we also said that these zeros and ones that we have we have different ways to represent them.

Maybe using a transistor or a light bulb or a flash disk has its own system of saving these zeros and

ones.

So let's have an example.

Let's put these boxes.

-- here assume a box view exists 

And let's say that this is our own way of representing these zeros and ones.

So they could be transistors.

They could be light bulbs. we dont care about this okay.

And in each one of these boxes we can have two different states.

We can either have a one or we can have a zero.

And again this is the most basic thing we have.

This is the most basic unit that we have in computers.

Now each one of these boxes can hold one bit.

So one bit one of these boxes could either hold on or off.

Could either hold 1 or 0 okay.

And well one byte is simply equals eight bits.

1byte = 8bits

So one byte is eight bits grouped together.

So if I say that I have 1101, if I say that I have this amount of data, my data is one and zero

And that means that I have four bits of data okay.

now 0 1 0 1 1
what exactly is?

Well if we pull these out from the box we're going to end up with this which will is a number. and binary numbers also called as base 2 numbers.

left most bit is most significant bit
right most bit is least significant bit.
now this is base 2 numbers so that from right to left we can calculate
1 * 2^0 = 1;
1 * 2^1 = 2;
0 * 2^2 = 0;
1 * 2^3 = 8;
0 * 2^4 = 0;

so final value is 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 0 is 11;
so the decimel value for the above binary value is 11.
and note that left most zero's are going to give us 0. so we simple ignore it. our final binary value is 1 0 1 1
