1. echo "Some string"

2. echo "Some string" | tr " " "\n"

Now in 2nd command
    So I just ran one command that is echo command. But this command is going to grab the output and then it's going to give it to the TR application.
    And this TR is just going to replace all empty strings with a new line character.


Here echo and tr are unix executable files. Both are like applications.
