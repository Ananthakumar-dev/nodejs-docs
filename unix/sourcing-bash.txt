syntax: source filepath(file should be a shell file)

example: source ./scripts.sh

So we can just say source and then specify our file just like that.

It's going to run it.

And then it's going to take all the functions and variables and aliases and put them in the current shell.

It's like exporting our variables and functions to our current shell from file.
