Now when you have a piece of data and your operating system, you indicate how to interpret that piece of data using file extensions.

So suppose you have a sequence of bits.

It could be a file.

And now you want to open that in your operating system.

Your operating system uses these file extensions to figure out how to open that file.

For example dot PDF or dot CSS or dot js or dot jpg.

So your operating system will take a look at the file extension.

And depending upon what that file extension is, it will try to open it using different applications.

So it now knows whether to open that file using a character encoding or using an image encoding, or using what kind of applications, so to speak.

So this is how we tell the operating system how to understand a piece of zeros and ones.

Format of mime-type is:
    type/subtype:key=value

    here key=value is the parameters which is optional.
    example: text/css
            text/html;charset=utf-8

We've got two different classes of media types.

We've got the discrete class and we've also got the multi-part class.

It's very easy to understand if the class is discrete.

It means that it's only one file.

It's a single file, and if it's multi-part, it means that it's multiple files.
