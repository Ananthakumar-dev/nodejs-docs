We have a CPU, Ram, network card, Storage on mother board.

and we have operating system on top of it. 

assume we have only two cores and that cores can operate only two threads.

now we attach a keyboard to the cpu via opeating system.

so now synchronous means when use typing a input from keyboard cpu core assignes one of the precisous thread to constantly listening keyboard only. that core does not doing anything beyond it. that is synchronous.
