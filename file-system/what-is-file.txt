We could say that a file is a sequence of bits, meaning of which is defined by the user.

But each sequence of bits might mean a different thing depending upon how you want to decode that data.

So it's important that we say how we want to open the file, how we want to decode those zeros and ones.

Now file could represent different things.

It could represent a program or they could represent maybe some data.

Data could mean an image, a video file or something that's in a free form, like a text file, like a JavaScript file.

So that's really what a file is.
